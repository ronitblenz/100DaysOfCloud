# Introduction to DevOps

This is an _all-in-one_ guide and walkthrough about DevOps, the responsibility, the technology behind it and the tools in use.

## What is DevOps?

Mostly, people define DevOps like something really alien to us.

But DevOps is nothing but just a way of working between Development and Operations Team to make the process of software release and maintainance easier and efficient.

**This is what DevOps means to everyone, no rocket science!**

 - And here comes the Defination, if you want to note down :

  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

## Origination

 - Actually, when there was no concept of DevOps in the industry, Companies had two teams. 
  - ```Development```
  - ```Operations```
 
 In Layman terms,
  - **Developers** are those who basically did the programming and software development stuffs.
  - **Operators** are those people who deployed those applications on large scale manually.
 
 - So there was a communication barrier between the two teams and companies faced _down-times_ while deployment. Apart from that, this was not really efficient for the industry standards.
 - Hence, the ```DevOps``` was born.

## Evolving Phase

 ### Phase - I
 - The first version of DevOps was coined as ```Waterfall```.
 - But it had few loopholes like,
 
  - Ineffective process
  - Over time new requirements may arise
  - Many points of failure and miscommunication
  - No fast feedback
 
 - Here is the visual representation :

 ### Phase - II
 - The ```Waterfall``` was later replaced by a new practice which was coined as ```Agile```.
 - It was proved to be much more advanced and efficient way to deliver a software in the market.
 - The Benefits are,
 
  - Fast speeds of Development, Testing and Deployment Cycles
  - Immediate Feedback
  - **Scrum** and **Kanban** specific Implementations

- Here is the visual representation :

## Relation Between Agile and DevOps

 - **AGILE Process:** Product Requirement --> Development Team building the Product.
 - **DevOps Process:** Developed Product -->  Operations Team releasing the Product.

## The Culture

 - Nowadays, DevOps is so widely accepted by every company that a new role known as ```DevOps Engineer``` has come into existance.
 - It's a medium of communication between the teams of the company.
 - As a result, many tools are emerging on a daily basis which makes the life of a DevOps engineer much more easier.
