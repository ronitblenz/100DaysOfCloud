# Git for DevOps

## Introduction

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

 - Now the first question that arises is, we relate to ```version controlling``` while defining Git, so what is version controlling?
   - The purpose of version control is to allow software teams track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members. Version control facilitates a continuous, simple way to develop software.

 - In one sentence, Git handles the Version Control System for a piece of Code which is present in local machine as well as on GitHub or GitLab.
 - Now new words come into play, ```GitHub``` and ```GitLab```
   - GitHub provides code hosting services that allow developers to build software for open-source and private projects in organizations.
   - GitLab does the same, while in addition, it has Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and DevOps workflows built-in.
**(FUN FACT : GitHub is acquired by Microsoft, that's why GitLab transferred their database from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud Provider, just competitor things, haha!)**

 - For our convenience as a cloud/DevOps engineer, We will work with GitLab in this case.
